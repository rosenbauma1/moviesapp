CRUD Movie application using AngularJS and Spring Boot

This application is a continuation from cloud foundry's bluegreen tutorial, which I used to turn into the movie application found here: 
http://movies-alr-rcl.cfapps.io/

Look at the src/main/resources directory for the angular code. The back end application was built seperately and can be found on my github profile.
